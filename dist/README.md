## Installation
Because this is a Node.js application that runs from a machine and not a browser, I can't deploy this to GitHub pages. If anyone ever wants to look at the application, you have to clone it to your own local machine and run it from there.
## Usage
The application will be invoked by using the following command: node index.js
## License
